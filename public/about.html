<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My career goal is to develop new and improved technology for the betterment of society. 
  Through creative use of technology, I believe real and impactful change can be made in the pursuit of aiding victims of bullying and abuse,
  those with physical disabilities, the elderly in assisted living facilities, individuals suffering from mental health issues, etc.

<p>As a passion, I invest for the desire of financial freedom. 
  I am currently working on creating a software company, 
  improving my skills as a day trader, and growing my asset column in real estate.
